Howdy, I'm a PhD student in the mathematics department at UCSB. I study quantum topology and its connections to quantum computing and low dimensional topology. My research is supervised by Professor Zhenghan Wang.

In my free time, I enjoy running, gardening, and exploring new music and films.

I include differentiable manifolds, tensors and differentiable forms. Lie groups and homogenous spaces, integration on manifolds, and in addition provide a proof of the de Rham theorem via sheaf cohomology theory, and develop the local theory of elliptic operators culminating in a proof of the Hodge theorem.  Those interested in any of the diverse areas of mathematics requiring the notion of a differentiable manifold will find me extremely useful.  </p> <p>Which Springer GTM would <i>you</i> be?  <a href="http://math.jhu.edu/~savitt/GTM.html">The Springer GTM Test</a></p></td></tr></table>
